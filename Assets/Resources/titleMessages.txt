I do not know if this piece of text will appear on screen correctly but I hope it does so that my programming skills are proven to be good. It took a while to figure out how to make the scrolling text actually work, but I've just proven that it works with even incredibly long pieces of text! Hahahaha! I'm actually the best at making text scroll across the screen without it being cut off randomly!
